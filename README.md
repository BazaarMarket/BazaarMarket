# What is Bazaar Market?

Bazaar Market is the first ever carbon-negative NFT Market, based on **OpenMinter**, an open source platform for making dApps on Tezos. 

## How does it work?

Tezos is a Proof of Stake blockchain, to which many people are switching because of it's extreme power efficiency and minimal gas prices, compared to Ethereum.
TQTezos has created a suite of Open Source software to help open development up to everyone, and that's where Bazaar comes in. Bazaar is an NFT Marketplace that offsets each of it's NFTs. It's estimated that one NFT on Tezos produces 0.00018 kgs of CO2. To offset this carbon footprint, each NFT transaction has a standard 2.5% platform fee, of which, 0.1% goes to our *Green Pool.* This treasury is then distributed to carbon-offset companies based on the will of the ***Bazaar Community***.

> The Bazaar Community is a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, that is regulated using our very own governance token, sDAO. This token allows us to distribute government representation throughout the community and allow users to guide the evolution of the site.

On top of this 0.1% fee, users may opt-in to a carbon-offset donation for their artwork. This attribute that will follow the piece of art for the rest of it's lifetime, and serve as a form of *status*.

>Various donations/attributes will be added in the future such as: Ocean Cleanup, Deforestation, Cancer Research, COVID-19 Research, and more. (These options will be decided by the Community) 

The combination of our *Green Fee* as well as the *Offset Donation*, will serve to not only carbon-*offset* our site, but will also make our site carbon-*negative*. 

## Why does this need to exist?

"Tezos is a very efficient ecosystem already!" - angry Twitter follower exclaims.
Yes, but there is always room for improvement. Even though emissions are much lower on PoS, they are not zero. That is our goal. Zero emissions. 

Outside of this endeavor, our site also features a very clean user interface, cross-platform NFT compatibility, VIP artist drops, user verification to thwart would be ***copy-minters***, and charity drops, which all make Bazaar Market stand out in a competitive NFT environment.

We believe that Bazaar Market is the next big thing for Tezos NFTs, and we'd love your help in getting it there.

## Tell me more about decentralized governance!

Bazaar Market's governance token is called bDAO. bDAO is a FA2 fungible asset, that was created using FA2 Bakery. The DAO was created using BaseDAO; it is a RegistryDAO, which means it can regulate the distribution of both FA2 and XTZ tokens.

>This allows the Community to control the creation and sale of Bazaar Tokens (or BATOs), which is Bazaar's custom NFT. It also regulates how fees are distributed amongst Community Members (bDAO holders). 

It also has the built-in capability for voting, making updates to the DAO, and regulating the dispersion of *Green Pool* funds. bDAO has governance both on and off-chain, which allows it to be flexible enough to decentralize a public marketplace like Bazaar. Lastly, it gives the community power to vote on ***Community Initiatives***, such as curating charity drops, and our special future ***Social Experimentsâ„¢***

**Summary:**

### bDAO Details:
 - Token Type: FA2
 - Total Circulation: 500,000 bDAO
 - Governance Type: Registry
 -  Quorum: 333,333 bDAO (2/3 Majority)
 -  Staking Minimum: 10,000 bDAO
 - Voting Period: 5 Days
 - Profit Distribution: 50% Community Members (bDAO Holders), 30% Website Users, 10% Treasury, 10% Development

## What steps are next?

Currently, the website is almost ready for it's alpha release, but we need funding to hire developers to help finalize and test our smart contracts. To help secure funding, bDAO Tokens will be dispersed throughout the next week via Airdrops and asset swaps. This will also begin to decentralize the project, and give the reigns to the Community. More information will be provided in our full roadmap, coming soon!
