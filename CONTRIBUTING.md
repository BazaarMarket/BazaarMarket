## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed anything major, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes and your code lints.
6. Open the PR, specifically targeting our `develop` branch.
