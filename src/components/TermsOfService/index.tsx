        1. Introduction \
Welcome to Bazaar Market’s website, owned and operated by McIntyre Industries LLC. d/b/a Bazaar (“Bazaar,” “we,” “us” or “our”). These Terms of Use (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of Bazaar’s website; including without limitation the creation, purchase, sale, exchange, or modification of certain digital assets; our online and/or mobile services, and software provided on or in connection with those services (collectively, the “Service”). \
This Service also allows you to sell and purchase Crypto Assets (as defined below) via fixed-price listings (“listings”). You may only participate in the Marketplace by linking your digital wallets on supported bridge extensions such as Temple Wallet ([https://templewallet.com/](https://templewallet.com/)). Temple Wallet is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Tezos cryptocurrency. Before listing your unique digital asset for sale or purchasing a unique digital asset from another user, we will ask you to download a supported electronic wallet extension, and connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an order to sell or purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf. \
“Crypto Assets” refers to unique non-fungible tokens, implemented on the Tezos blockchain (the “Tezos Platform”) using smart contracts (e.g. Kalamint NFTs, OBJKTs, Button NFTs, and of course ‘BATO’, or ‘Bazaar Tokens’). \
ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY THIRD-PARTY ELECTRONIC WALLET EXTENSIONS, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS. FOR TEMPLE WALLET, THOSE TERMS ARE AVAILABLE AT ([https://templewallet.com/terms](https://templewallet.com/terms)) AND ([https://templewallet.com/privacy](https://templewallet.com/privacy)) \
BAZAAR IS A PLATFORM. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OR CREDITOR. THE SERVICES ARE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLATFORM ONLY. BAZAAR FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER IN LISTINGS BUT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER OF CRYPTO ASSETS OR BETWEEN ANY USERS. \
YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS YOU PURCHASE ON BAZAAR. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, BAZAAR MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS ON THE PLATFORM. \
Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe additional terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services. \
THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE READ SECTION 15 CAREFULLY. \
BY CLICKING ON THE “LOGIN” BUTTON, CONNECTING YOUR VIRTUAL WALLET WITH BEACON, USING OUR SERVICES AND/OR PURCHASING CRYPTO ASSETS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service or purchase the Crypto Assets. \
Bazaar reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage you to review the Terms frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may not access or use the Service.
2. Privacy Policy \
Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://bazaarnft.xyz/privacy) for information about how we collect, use and share personal information about you.
3. Account Registration and Communication Preferences
    1. If you wish to participate in Listing Crypto Assets, you will need to register for an account on the Service (“Account”). By creating an Account, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete Account information about yourself, (b) maintain and promptly update from time to time as necessary your Account information, (c) maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your Account and the information you provide to us, and (d) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Service, or your Account. Bazaar will block multiple accounts of the same user. Also, you agree that you will not:
        * create another account if we’ve disabled one you had unless you have our written permission first;
        * buy, sell, rent or lease access to your Account or username unless you have our written permission first;
        * share your Account password with anyone; or
        * log in or try to log in to access the Service through unauthorized third party applications or clients.
    2. Bazaar may require you to provide additional information and documents at the request of any competent authority or in case of application of any applicable law or regulation, including laws related to anti-laundering (legalization) of incomes obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism. Bazaar may also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases where it has reasons to believe that:
        * Your Account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity;
        * You have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or
        * Transactions effected via your Account were affected in breach of these Terms.
    3. In such cases, Bazaar, in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel your Listing transactions until such additional information and documents are reviewed by Bazaar and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, Bazaar may refuse to provide the Content (defined in Section 4(A) below) to you.
    4. By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from Bazaar (e.g., via email or by posting notices to the Service). These communications may include notices about your Account (e.g., password changes and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that such communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of electronic communications from us by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. We may also send you promotional communications via email, including, but not limited to, newsletters, special offers, surveys and other news and information we think will be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these promotional emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided therein.
    5. By submitting personal data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of our [Privacy Policy](https://bazaarnft.xyz/privacy) and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with the [Privacy Policy](https://bazaarnft.xyz/privacy).
    6. You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the Service and services, including but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to connect with and use Service and services, in cases where the Service offers a mobile component. You are solely responsible for any fees, including Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing the Service or services.
    7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, the Service and Content may include software components provided by Bazaar or its affiliates or a third party that are subject to separate license terms, in which case those license terms will govern such software components. For example, when you click to get more details about any of the Crypto Assets sold through our marketplace, you will notice a third party link to the website from which such Crypto Asset originated. Such websites may include license terms governing the use of such Crypto Asset. In the event you purchase such Crypto Asset through our marketplace, you are required to comply with such terms.
    8. As stated above, your participation in Listings is also subject to the rules available on this page, Listing Rules.

11. Bazaar facilitates trade among a diverse community of buyers and sellers. Openness is one of our most prized values, and we're committed to providing a platform for the exchange of a wide range of content, including controversial content. These policies ensure that our marketplace offers the widest selection of assets possible while promoting trust and respect, as well as adherence to the law. \
Bazaar has always exercised judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of openness in a worldwide community of users of a radical new technology. We carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our policies before deciding to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections when we discover them or they're brought to our attention. \
Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that Bazaar deems inappropriate, disruptive, or illegal are prohibited on Bazaar. Bazaar reserves the rights to determine the appropriateness of listings on its site and remove any listing at any time. If you create or offer an asset, listing, smart contract, or collection in violation of these policies, we will take corrective actions, as appropriate, including but not limited to removing the asset, listing, smart contract, or collection, deleting your Bazaar account, and permanently withholding referral payments and developer revenue sharing fees. Bazaar cannot destroy or impound your assets or smart contracts, but we reserve the right to destroy inappropriate metadata stored on our servers. \
Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that include metadata that violates international or United States intellectual property laws, promotes suicide or self-harm, incites hate or violence against others, degrades or doxes another individual, depicts minors in sexually suggestive situations, or is otherwise illegal in the United States are prohibited on Bazaar and will be removed. \
Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections with a primary or substantial purpose in a game or application that violates international or United States intellectual property laws, promotes suicide or self-harm, incites hate or violence against others, degrades or doxes another individual, depicts minors in sexually suggestive situations, or is otherwise illegal in the United States are prohibited on Bazaar and will be removed. \
Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections created or used primarily or substantially for the purpose of raising funds for the known terrorist organizations listed on [https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/) are prohibited on Bazaar and will be removed. \
The sale of stolen assets, converted assets, fraudulently obtained assets, assets taken without authorization, and other illegally obtained assets on Bazaar is prohibited. Listing illegally obtained assets may result in your listings being cancelled, your assets being hidden, or your account being suspended. \
If you have reason to believe that an asset listed on Bazaar was illegally obtained, please contact us immediately at bazaarnft@gmail.com. Include the asset's ID, the asset's contract address, and evidence demonstrating that the asset was illegally obtained. Bazaar will review your claim and reply within 72 hours. If we determine from the evidence that the asset is stolen, we will hide it or disable trading of it. \
We require all users to be 18 years old or older. If you are under 18, you may use a parent or guardian's Bazaar account, but only with involvement of the account holder. However, the account holder is responsible for everything done with that account. \
NSFW content is meant for people who are 18 years and older. We allow the sale of this content, but it is subject to being marked NSFW and handled differently than non-NSFW content in navigation menus and search results. Asset names, listings and their descriptions, smart contract names, and collections including profanity or overtly sexual content are prohibited on Bazaar and will be removed. A smart contract that contains NSFW content is subject to being marked NSFW, even if the NSFW content only represents a portion of the content on the smart contract. \
Do not create or list illegal or offensive content, such as products that depict graphic sexual acts and images that depict children under the age of 18 in a sexually suggestive manner. Do not use profanity or graphic language in any content you list or create on Bazaar. \
Bottom line about NSFW content: it's permitted on Bazaar, but we're going to do our best to keep it out of the high traffic areas and if it's extreme in any way, we'll probably remove it. \
If you become aware of the creation, listing, or buying of assets in violation of any of the terms specified in this section, you shall contact us [here](mailto:bazaarnft@gmail.com) to report it. Creators bear special responsibility for informing Bazaar of the existence of their collections, contracts, and assets that violate these terms.
12. User Information and Copyright \

Bazaar does not claim that submitting, posting or displaying User Information on or through the Services gives Bazaar any ownership or resale rights in your User Information. We're not saying we own it or will resell it. We're just saying we might show it off a bit. \

15. Disclaimers \
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN A WRITING BY BAZAAR, THE SERVICE, CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN, AND CRYPTO ASSETS LISTED THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BAZAAR (AND ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE: (A) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (B) WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS; OR (C) WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. BAZAAR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO THE SERVICE, CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN. BAZAAR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT CONTENT ON THE SERVICE IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT OR ERROR-FREE. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF ANY KIND FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN OR TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON MATERIAL OR INFORMATION, CONTAINED ON THE SERVICE. WHILE BAZAAR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE AND CONTENT SAFE, BAZAAR CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE, CONTENT, ANY CRYPTO ASSETS LISTED ON OUR SERVICE OR OUR SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE ONLINE. YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET AND WILL NOT HOLD US RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. \
WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OF CRYPTO ASSETS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (A) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED ADDRESSES; (B) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS; (E) ANY UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE SERVICE OR CRYPTO ASSETS. \
CRYPTO ASSETS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE TEZOS NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE TEZOS PLATFORM. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT BAZAAR OR ANY BAZAAR PARTY CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY CRYPTO ASSETS. \
Bazaar is not responsible for sustained casualties due to vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart contract), blockchains or any other features of the Crypto Assets. Bazaar is not responsible for casualties due to late reports by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the blockchain supporting Crypto Assets including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result. \
Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability of either party for fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of laws, or any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded by legitimate means. \
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
16. Assumption of Risk \
You accept and acknowledge:
    46. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the Crypto Assets, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Crypto Assets will not lose money.
    47. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Crypto Assets transactions. Neither Bazaar nor any other Bazaar Party is responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Crypto Assets transactions.
    48. Our Service does not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets. This is because Crypto Assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of Crypto Assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on this Service.
    49. There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Bazaar will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Crypto Assets, however caused.
    50. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of Crypto Assets.
    51. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Listing and/or Service and the utility of Crypto Assets.
    52. The Service will rely on third-party platforms such as Temple Wallet to perform the transactions for theListing of Crypto Assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
    53. There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. Bazaar reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on Bazaar. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on Bazaar serve as grounds for a claim against Bazaar.

ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM. \
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF BAZAAR ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE, CONTENT, CRYPTO ASSETS, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED ON THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY BAZAAR FROM THE SALE OF CRYPTO ASSETS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. \
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY OF BAZAAR FOR (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF BAZAAR’S NEGLIGENCE; OR FOR (B) ANY INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF BAZAAR’S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION \
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.
19. Modifications to the Service \
We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any features or parts thereof) or suspend or discontinue the Listing at any time and without liability therefore.
20. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration.
    54. Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Bazaar and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
    55. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to any aspect of your relationship with Bazaar, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Bazaar may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
    56. Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send an email to [bazaarnft@gmail.com](mailto:bazaarnft@gmail.com). The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at[ http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/); all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at[ http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/). JAMS’s rules are also available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Bazaar will pay them for you. In addition, Bazaar will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    57. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Bazaar. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non- monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
    58. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND BAZAAR HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Bazaar are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 15(b) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
    59. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
    60. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to [bazaarnft@gmail.com](mailto:bazaarnft@gmail.com), within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
    61. Severability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
    62. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Bazaar.
    63. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Bazaar makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to Bazaar at [bazaarnft@gmail.com](mailto:bazaarnft@gmail.com).

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Bazaar prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and Bazaar’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
