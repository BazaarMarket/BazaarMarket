### Purpose
The general purpose of the FA2 minter will be to create an open-source tool to allow anyone to create, manage, and use assets on the Tezos blockchain. The goal is to allow users to have an abstracted interface to easily create any type of asset (fungible, semi-fungible, non-fungible), deploy their own associated contracts for those assets, manage them with an accessible functions interface (mint additional assets, transfer assets, analytics, etc.), and use them via third-party services (exchanges, auctions, voting - DAOs, and games). 

### First Release Goals

The initial goal for a first release will be to create an interface to enable users to mint, view, and transfer their NFTs. This first iteration will use a single contract to create the assets in order to avoid any metadata issues before its standardized. Users will connect their wallets in order to pay the fee for transactions. After the transaction is paid for, users will have the ability to view the assets associated with their accounts, view details about them, and have the ability to transfer them. 

#### On Future Releases 

Future iterations will include extended functionality on all three factors of the application. First, we wish for users to have the ability to create any asset-type they wish to create, coupled with the ability to tie assets together via contextual baskets. After that, the management of assets will eventually evolve to the management of individual assets (minting additional, etc.), analytics about particular assets, and the ability to import existing assets created outside of the minter application. Coupled with this could be plugins that enable creative ways of using particular assets such as an external marketplace to buy and sell NFTs, DAO-applications that allow you to vote directly from the management console or even games. Identity and profiles will be an element to also explore in future iterations.
